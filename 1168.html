experiment</h3><div>In contrast to the ant-aphid experiment, we found that
the abiotic environment tended to be more important than willow genotype
in structuring the arthropod community (Table S3). In particular,
willows growing in wind-exposed plots hosted 51% fewer species
(ùúé2 = 11%, œá1 = 13.55, P &lt;
0.001), 47% fewer individuals (Fig. 1B; ùúé2 = 2%,

(Fig. 1D; ùúé2 = 23%, F1,7.8 = 22.82, P
= 0.001) compared to unexposed willows. In spite of the effects of wind
exposure, willow genotype had clear effects on both the richness
(~3-fold differences, ùúé2 = 6%,
œá9 = 28.01, P &lt; 0.001) and abundance (Fig. 1B;
~5-fold differences, ùúé2 = 5%,
œá9 = 25.25, P = 0.003) of arthropods, but only a
marginal effect on rarefied richness (Fig. 1D; ùúé2 =
5%, F9,71.1 = 1.96, P = 0.058). Arthropod communities
on willows had both more species (ùúé2 = 4%,
œá1 = 10.33, P = 0.001) and more individuals
(ùúé2 = 2%, œá1 = 6.72, P = 0.010) in
the second year of the experiment compared to the first; however, we
also conducted more arthropod surveys for the wind experiment in 2013
vs. 2012. In terms of community composition, we observed strong effects
of wind exposure by the end of experiment (Fig. 2B;
R 2adj = 40%,
F1,68 = 12.80, P = 0.001). These compositional
differences were driven primarily by gall midges (Family: Cecidomyiidae)
being relatively less abundant on wind-exposed willows
(œá1 = 16.28, P &lt; 0.001), whereas leaf-tiering
moths (Family: Tortricidae) were insensitive to wind exposure (and
therefore relatively more abundant; œá1 = 15.62, P
&lt; 0.001). Although several arthropod taxa varied in total
abundance among willow genotypes (Table S4), we did not detect an effect
of genotype on community composition in either year of the experiment
(2012: F9,51 = 0.96, P = 0.502; 2013:
F9,68 = 1.17, P =
0.271).</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Do willow genetic and environmental
variation have different effects on above and belowground

root-associated fungal and bacterial communities compared to foliar

0.90, P = 0.369) nor willow genotype (F9,95.0 = 1.21, P

However, the composition of the fungal community did vary among willow
genotypes (Fig. 2C; ùúé2 = 1%, F9,117 =
1.00, P = 0.005) with no detectable effect of wind-exposure
(F1,9 = 1.19, P = 0.162). Genotypic differences in
fungal community composition were due to variation in the relative

ùúé2 = 7%, F1,7.9 = 6.52, P = 0.034).
While wind exposure had a marginal effect on the composition of the
bacteria community (Fig. 2D;

of willow genotype on any aspect of the bacterial community (rarefied

Specifically, two clones (S and T) produced ~4-fold more
trichomes when aphids were absent, whereas genotype L produced 3-fold
more trichomes when aphids were present (Table S1).</div><div class="ltx_p">Using structural equation models (for richness, abundance, and rarefied
richness) and redundancy analysis (for community composition), we found
that heritable trait variation and direct effects of aphid additions
were the primary determinants of the arthropod community rather than
phenotypic plasticity (Table 1). The effect of heritable trait variation
on arthropod richness and abundance was mediated primarily by plant
trait PC1 (Fig. 2A,B). Plant height, shoot count, and shoot length all
had strong, positive loadings on trait PC1 (Table S5), indicating that
larger willows hosted more arthropod species and individuals. Arthropod
abundance was also positively influenced by the addition of aphids,
primarily because A. farinosa attracted other ant species
(Pearson‚Äôs r = 0.42, t282 = 7.74, P &lt;
0.001) and these other ants were the second most abundant taxonomic
group in the community. In contrast to total abundance, the addition of
aphids negatively affected rarefied richness (Fig. 2C). This negative
effect was due in part to aphid additions attracting more F.
obscuripes, an active generalist predator that likely consumed or
inhibited the colonization of other arthropods. In terms of composition,
we found that the abundance of A. farinosa was the only factor
(of the mechanisms we modeled) influencing the arthropod community
(F1,183 = 2.86, P = 0.025). Specifically, higher
abundance of A. farinosa resulted in an increase in the
proportional abundance of other ant species in the community (Fig. 2D).</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">Despite our detailed analysis of potential mechanisms, our structural

experiment</h3><div>One of the mechanisms by which wind exposure could
influence willow-associated communities is through accumulated effects
on soil properties; however, we observed only modest effects of wind
exposure on soil properties (Table S2). Specifically, soil in
wind-exposed plots was marginally drier (F1,9.0 = 3.52,
0.093) with higher amounts of total Nitrogen (F1,9.0 =
5.08, 0.051) than in unexposed plots, but there was no clear difference
in either percent organic matter (F1,8.4 = 0.68, 0.434)
or nutrient composition (F1,9.0 = 1.31, 0.282).</div><div></div><div class="ltx_p">As with the ant-aphid experiment, we hypothesized that the effects of
wind exposure and willow genotype on associated communities would be
mediated by plant traits. Interestingly, we found that plant-growth and
leaf quality traits responded differently to wind exposure and willow
genetic variation (Table S2). For example, wind exposure negatively
affected all plant-growth traits (plant height F1,9.0 =
29.10, P &lt; 0.001; shoot count œá1 = 9.91, P =
0.002; shoot length F1,9.0 = 10.44, P = 0.010).
Moreover, the negative effects of wind exposure were magnified by the
end of the experiment for both plant height (F1,158.4 =
16.69, P &lt; 0.001) and the number of shoots produced
(œá1 = 12.53, P &lt; 0.001). Still, willow
genotype had a pronounced effect on all plant-growth traits, resulting
in willows that varied over 2-fold in height (F9,145.3 =

47.42, P &lt; 0.001), and shoot length (F9,144.2
= 4.97, P &lt; 0.001) among the most disparate genotypes. While
the effect of willow genotype on the number of shoots changed by the end

(R2 = 0.05) compared to the effect of genotype
alone (R2 = 0.13). In contrast to plant-growth
traits, willow genotype was the primary factor in determining leaf
traits across both years of the experiment (Table S2). The leaves of
willow genotypes varied 46-fold in trichome density (œá9
= 67.31, P &lt; 0.001), 1.5-fold in SLA (F9,122.5
= 4.21, P &lt; 0.001), and 1.6-fold in C:N
(F9,70.5 = 4.88, P &lt; 0.001). We had data
available on leaf water content for 2012 and 2013, and we found that the
amount of variation explained by willow genotype depended on the
sampling year (F9,141.6 = 2.80, P = 0.005; 2012,
R2 = 0.11; 2013, R2 =
0.16). Unlike aboveground plant traits, root C:N did not appear to be
influenced by either wind exposure (F1,8.7 = 0.31, P =
0.590) or willow genotype (F9,107.0 = 0.85, P = 0.569).</div><div class="ltx_p">Similar to the ant-aphid experiment, we found that heritable trait
variation and direct effects of wind exposure were the primary factors
influencing the arthropod community rather than phenotypic plasticity
(Table 1). Both trait PC1 and PC2 mediated the indirect effects of
willow genetic variation and wind exposure (negative) on the arthropod
community (Fig. 3A), but the effects of heritable trait variation were
relatively stronger (Table 1). Trait PC1 had a strong, positive effect
on arthropod richness (std. coef. = 0.37), abundance (std. coef. =
0.28), and rarefied richness (std. coef = 0.37, Fig. 3A). Similar to the
ant-aphid experiment, trait PC1 had strong, positive associations with
plant height, shoot count, and shoot length (Table S5), indicating that
larger willows hosted more arthropod species. Trait PC2 had a smaller,
but negative effect on arthropod richness (std. coef. = -0.13),
abundance (std. coef. = -0.15), and rarefied richness (std. coef. =
-0.12, Fig. 3A). Trait PC2 had a strong positive correlation with leaf
C:N, but strong negative correlations with leaf water content and SLA
(Table S5), indicating that willows with poorer quality leaf tissue
hosted fewer arthropod species. Although the community-level effects of
wind exposure due to phenotypic plasticity were relatively weak, wind
exposure had strong and direct, negative effects on arthropod richness
(std. coef. = -0.22), abundance (std. coef. = -0.08), and rarefied
richness (std. coef. = -0.26, Fig. 3A). The qualitative effects of
heritable trait variation, phenotypic plasticity, and direct
environmental effects held for the richness, abundance, and rarefied
richness of foliar arthropods in the first year of the experiment as
well (C22 = 28.76, P = 0.152), except that trait PC2 was
determined by different traits (Table S5) and did not appear to affect
any aspect of the arthropod community (richness, P = 0.657; abundance, P
= 0.104; rarefied richness, P = 0.850). For community composition, we
only analyzed the data from the second year of the experiment because
this was the only year for which we detected a significant effect of
wind exposure. We found that the effects of wind exposure on community
composition were primarily mediated by plant trait PC1
(F1,76 = 12.05, P = 0.001). Positive values of trait PC1
(i.e. larger plants) had greater proportional abundance of gall midges,
leaf-mining moths, and spiders, whereas leaf-tiering moths were
insensitive to plant size (Fig. 7B).</div><div class="ltx_p">As with the aboveground community, we found that heritable trait
variation and direct environmental effects were the primary determinants
of rhizosphere communities, although we did a poorer job of identifying
the specific mechanisms. For example, we previously showed that fungal
community composition varied among willow genotypes (Table S3), but we
failed to identify the root traits mediating the effect of willow
genetic variation (F9,106 = 1.03, P = 0.002). Our
failure to identify this process is not surprising though, given that we
measured only one belowground plant trait (root C:N) and it was not
strongly influenced by willow genotype. While wind exposure only had a
modest effect on soil properties, soil characteristics had strong direct
effects on the rarefied richness of rhizosphere communities. For
example, soil PC1 (std. coefs. = -0.28), and to a lesser extent root C:N
(std. coefs. = -0.22), negatively affected fungal rarefied richness
(Fig. 3A). Soil PC1 had strong positive correlations with soil moisture
and organic matter, but negative correlations with
NO3- and
NH4+ (Table S6), indicating that
fungal communities were more diverse in drier environments with more
available nitrogen. In contrast, soil PC2 was the primary factor in
determining bacterial rarefied richness (std. coef. = 0.25).
Micronutrients such as Ca2+, Mg2+,
and Cd2+ had strong positive loadings on soil PC2,
indicating that bacterial richness was greater in environments with more
of these micronutrients. Although we detected clear effects of soil
properties and root C:N on rarefied richness of root-associated
communities, none of these soil and plant characteristics were strong
predictors of rhizosphere community composition (Table S7).</div><div class="ltx_p">In contrast to the ant-aphid experiment, our structural equation models
provided good fits to our data (i.e., P &gt; 0.05), indicating
that we identified the key processes affecting the richness (Fig. 7A;
C10 = 2.94, P = 0.983), abundance (C10 =
6.73, P = 0.751), and rarefied richness (C32 = 21.63, P

Still, we did find that aphid additions modified the effect of willow

accurately predicting community assembly requires an understanding of
both factors. In the wind experiment, we found that wind exposure
dominated willow genotype in the strength of its effect on foliar
arthropods. Despite the importance of wind exposure in shaping arthropod
composition, willow genotype still had predictable effects on individual
arthropod guilds. Taken together, our study suggests that host-plant

be equally important in structuring foliar arthropod communities in

that have simultaneously measured the responses of above and belowground
assemblages. We found that foliar arthropods responded differently than
root-associated fungi and bacteria to willow genetic and environmental
variation, suggesting that these communities are responding to different
plant traits and environmental correlates of wind exposure. Similarly,
Lamit et al. (2015) found that communities of foliar arthropods
and ectomycorrhizal fungi did not covary across genotypes of narrowleaf
cottonwood (Populus angustifolia). The lack of covariation
between these communities is likely because these assemblages are
responding to different plant traits, although we did not fully identify
the root traits mediating fungal and bacteria communities. While we have
made substantial progress in the past decade understanding
plant-arthropod interactions, it is time that community genetics
research turns its attention belowground to understand the plant traits
influencing these diverse assemblages. This will have the added benefit
of understanding associations between above and belowground traits which
will be important for predicting when we would expect linkages between

Ant-aphid

host-plant genetic variation has strong bottom-up effects on ant-aphid
interactions (Johnson 2008; Mooney &amp; Agrawal 2008; Abdala‚ÄêRoberts
et al. 2012). As with other studies, we found that ant abundances
were strongly mediated by the effects of host-plant genetic variation on
aphid densities (Johnson 2008; Mooney &amp; Agrawal 2008). Johnson (2008)
found that heritable variation in leaf water content and trichome
density were important determinants of the densities of Aphis
oestlundi on evening primrose (Oenothera biennis); however, leaf
water content and trichome density were not associated with A.
farinosa abundance in our study, suggesting the traits mediating
plant-aphid interactions are species specific (Z√ºst &amp; Agrawal

found that the effects of host-plant genotype on the richness and
abundance of other arthropods were mediated, in part, by genotypic
differences in plant size rather than ant abundance. One possible reason
for this discrepancy is that the absolute variation in F.
obscuripes abundance was quite low in our experiment (max. genotype
average = ~0.5 individuals) compared to other studies
(max. genotype average = ~3 individuals), which was
likely due to the rather low abundance of aphids we observed (max.
genotype average = 7 individuals). While we failed to fully identify the
mechanisms (likely unmeasured plant traits) explaining arthropod
community responses in this experiment, our results do suggest that
host-plant evolution could have strong effects on arthropod community
structure, despite variability in this biotic factor.</div><div>Wind
experiment ‚Äî Our study supports the notion that wind is a key
environmental factor in structuring communities associated with host
plants in coastal dune ecosystems (Miller and Weis 1999; Crutsinger et
al. 2010, 2014). We found that the negative effects of wind exposure on
arthropod richness and abundance resulted from a combination of direct
effects on colonization as well as indirect effects mediated by wind
pruning and, to a lesser extent, reductions in leaf quality. Similarly,
Crutsinger et al. (2014) found that there were more arthropod
species and individuals on prostrate vs. erect morphs of coyote bush
(Baccharis piluaris), due to their low-lying growth form which
enabled them to be more productive than erect morphs at their windy
coastal dunes site.

variability in the abiotic environment and host-plant genetic variation,
making it difficult to draw other useful comparisons. The majority of
genotype-by-abiotic environment studies to date have used fertilizers to
manipulate soil nutrient availability (Abdala-Roberts &amp; Mooney 2013,
Orians &amp; Fritz 1996, Ross &amp; Stiling 1998), but it is unclear whether
these manipulations reflect natural variation in soil nutrients. This
may explain why the effects of variation in soil nutrients range from
being independent and weak (Abdala-Roberts &amp; Mooney 2013) to being
strong modifiers (Orians &amp; Fritz 1996) of host-plant genotype on
arthropod communities. The only other genotype-by-abiotic environment
study that we are aware of manipulated sun exposure by sea daisy
(Borrichia frutescens, Ross &amp; Stiling 1998) and, similar to our
study, observed strong, independent effects of sun exposure on densities
of the gall midge, Asphondylia borrichiae, presumably through
changes in carbon-based secondary metabolites. If we are to make
progress on understanding the relative importance of willow genotype vs.
environment for associated communities, future experimental work should
focus on manipulating natural variation in specific abiotic factors, or,
at the very least, measuring variability in abiotic factors to begin to
identify putative causal factors.</div><div class="ltx_title_paragraph">Conclusions</div><div>\label{conclusions}</div><div class="ltx_p">Overall, our study reinforces the importance of host-plant genetic
variation in shaping associated communities and extends this finding to
natural biotic and abiotic gradients in coastal dune ecosystems. Our
findings also suggest that predicting community responses to genetic and
environmental variation is a complex task that may depend on historical
processes that have shaped the genetic architecture for the populations
of interest (i.e. sensitivity to specific environmental factors). Still,
the effects of willow genetic variation were clear at both the level of
plant traits and the community structure of foliar arthropods and fungi.
Importantly, this suggests that host-plant evolution could have a strong
influence on the biodiversity of above and belowground communities.
Future studies should work toward understanding how these diverse
communities feedback to impose selection pressures on host plants as
well as how host-plant traits mediate interactions between above and

more synthetic understanding of the evolutionary ecology of host plants
and their diverse associated communities.</div>
