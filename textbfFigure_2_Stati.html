<b>Figure 2:</b> Statistical models of the processes mediating
arthropod community assembly in the ant-aphid experiment. Piecewise
structural equation models of arthropod richness (A), abundance (B), and
rarefied richness (C). Colored and white boxes represent exogenous and
endogenous variables, respectively. Solid, single-headed arrows
correspond to modeled pathways between predictor and response variables,
and may be either positive (black) or negative (red). Grey,
double-headed arrows denote variables with no direct relationship and
that we assumed to be driven by the same underlying factor. For clarity,
we only plotted paths with standardized coefficients &gt;
0.10. Numbers next to all arrows represent the standardized path
coefficient, which also corresponds to the thickness of arrows. (B)
Redundancy analysis illustrating the effect of plant traits (Trait PC1
square root of proportional abundances of species found on each willow).
Black and blue arrows correspond to plant traits and species,
respectively, while grey dots represent the position of individual
willow communities.</div>
