<div class="ltx_p"><b>Figure 2:</b> Effects of genetic variation within the willow Salix hookeriana as well as biotic (aphid additions) and abiotic (wind exposure) factors on the composition of above and belowground communities. In the ant-aphid experiment (A), the addition of the aphid Aphis farinosa (grey diamonds) modified the effect of willow genotype on the composition of the arthropod community. This interaction between willow genotype and aphid treatment was solely due to the differential effect of genotype J (solid line) on the abundance of non-A. farinosa aphids in the aphid treatment (Table S2). For arthropods in the wind experiment (B), we found that wind exposure had a strong effect on community composition in 2013 (but not 2012, Table S3), with no clear effect of willow genotype. Belowground, we found that willow genotype influenced the composition of rhizosphere fungi, while the composition of rhizosphere bacteria was only influenced by wind exposure. Black text and grey ellipses correspond to the community centroid ± 95% confidence interval. Grey numbers denote blocks and each unique number is the community centroid for the plot within each block. Grey circles mark the location of individual willow communities in multivariate space. We calculated the locations of centroids ± 95% confidence interval and individual samples using redundancy analysis on Hellinger-transformed community data.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div>
