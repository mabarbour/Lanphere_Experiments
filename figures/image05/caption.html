<div class="ltx_p"><div><b>Figure 3:</b> Statistical models of the processes mediating community assembly in the wind experiment for 2013. (A) Piecewise structural equation model of the rarefied richness of foliar arthropods as well as root fungi and bacteria. Colored and white boxes represent exogenous and endogenous variables, respectively. Solid, single-headed arrows correspond to modeled pathways between predictor and response variables, and may be either positive (black) or negative (red). Grey, double-headed arrows denote variables with no direct relationship and that we assumed to be driven by the same underlying factor. For clarity, we only plotted paths with standardized coefficients &gt; 0.10. Numbers next to all arrows represent the standardized path coefficient, which also corresponds to the thickness of arrows. (D) Redundancy analysis illustrating the effect of plant traits (Trait PC1 square root of proportional abundances of species found on each willow). Black and blue arrows correspond to plant traits and species, respectively, while grey</div><div> dots represent the position of individual willow communities.</div></div><div></div>
