Salix hookeriana as well as biotic (aphid additions and proximity
to ant mounds) and abiotic (wind exposure) factors on the structure of
above and belowground communities. Willow genotype had strong effects on
arthropod abundance in both the ant-aphid (A) and wind exposure (B)
experiments. In the ant-aphid experiment (A), arthropod abundance was
influenced by the addition of the aphid Aphis farinosa, but only
at the furthest distance from mounds of the ant Formica
obscuripes. In the wind experiment (B), wind exposure reduced arthropod
abundance. In contrast to arthropod abundance, willow genotype had weak
effects on arthropod rarefied richness in both the ant-aphid (C) and
wind exposure (D) experiments. In the ant-aphid experiment (C), the
addition of aphids reduced the probability of encountering a different
arthropod species (rarefied richness). In the wind experiment (D), wind
exposure dramatically reduced arthropod rarefied richness. Similar to
arthropod rarefied richness, willow genotype had weak effects on the
rarefied richness of rhizosphere fungi (E) and bacteria (F). While wind
exposure had a weak effect on fungal rarefied richness (E), we found
that wind exposed willows hosted a more diverse community of rhizosphere
bacteria (F). Points and error bars correspond to the response
variable’s mean ± 95% confidence interval. We calculated mean and
confidence intervals based on the full models (Tables S1,S3) using the
‘effects’ package in R.</div>
