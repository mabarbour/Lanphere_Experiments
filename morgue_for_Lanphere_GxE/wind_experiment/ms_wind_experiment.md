#Action steps
- identify duplicate samples from original datasheets for C:N. Also, need to recover results from run 6 (run 5 only ended up being Chris' samples because I forgot to check off my samples before Chris' ended up finishing).
- finish data collection from lab samples

Objectives
----------

To examine the interactive effects of willow genotype and wind exposure on arthropod food webs.


Introduction
------------

I. Evidence for plant genotype in shaping plant traits and arthropod community
- Plant genotype influences biomass production

II. Evidence for wind pruning in shaping plant traits and arthropod community
- Wind pruning may decrease primary productivity as well as the architecture of the plant.

**Research Questions**
1. What is the relative importance of plant genotype vs. environment in structuring arthropod food webs?  
2. What are the underlying mechanisms shaping variation in arthropod food web structure?  

**Research Questions: July 11, 2013**
1. Do plant genotypes vary in their tolerance to wind exposure?  
**Biomass estimates**
- oven-dried (~60 C for 48 hrs) for: living shoot tissue, green plant tissue, living stem tissue, dead stem/shoot tissue.
**Plant Traits**
- C:N (leaf quality) **at least 5mg of tissue**
- SLA
- Height
- Spodoptera Bioassay
- Trichome density again?
2. How does plant genotype and wind exposure interact to influence herbivory and arthropod community composition?
**Herbivory**
- counts of number of leaves on each plant
- estimates of percent leaf area removed (PLAR) on each leaf by different herbivore species.  This will enable me to estimate PLAR for the entire plant.
- oven-dried leaf biomass. This will enable me to determine the average biomass for each leaf.  **Not necessary, can use just a few leaves**
- (SLA * PLAR)/(leaf biomass + SLA*PLAR) = Percent Biomass removed via herbivory! 
- for galling insects, I will simply measure the oven dry mass of the gall and use that as the degree of biomass damage to the plant.
**Arthropod Community Composition**
- already have estimates of community composition for all species at 4 different sampling dates over 2 years.


**Hypotheses**
We hypothesize that wind exposure would decrease primary productivity, leaf quality, and plant height; however, we expected plant genotypes to vary in their susceptibility to wind exposure.  In turn, we hypothesized that variation in primary productivity, leaf quality and plant height would influence both the size of arthropod food webs as well as food chain length.

**Network Hypotheses**
We hypothesized that wind exposure would decrease primary productivity, leaf tissue quality, and plant height.  We hypothesized that these changes in plant traits would decrease network size.  Finally, we hypothesized that the individual-based networks of plant genotypes in unexposed sites would be more dissimilar from each other than when they occur in exposed sites (i.e. the networks are homogenized).  

**John Chase Hypothesis**
I hypothesized that wind exposure would lead to a decrease in network size and make exposed sites more similar to each other, whereas networks at unexposed sites would be determined more by environmental stochasticity. NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE METHOD I USE TO PARTITION BETA DIVERSITY IS MULTIPLICATIVE (I THINK?) SO THAT I CAN TEASE OUT WHETHER THE EFFECT IS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASE IN SPECIES RICHNESS OR CHANGE IN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION.


#Methods

##Study Site
We conducted this research at Lanphere Dunes (40°53'29.85"N, 124° 8'49.06"W), a pristine coastal dune ecosystem managed by US Fish and Wildlife service in Humboldt County, California.  The willow *Salix hookeriana* naturally occurs in nearshore dune swales - seasonal freshwater wetlands that form in depressions between dune ridges [@Pickart2009].  Aside from our study species, the dominant vegetation in these swales consists of beach pine (*Pinus contorta* ssp. *contorta*) and slough sedge (*Carex obnupta*).  

##Experimental Design
Prior to bud burst in February 2012, we took shoot cuttings (40 cm length & ~0.5 cm diameter) from one to two replicates of 10 different *Salix hookeriana* genotypes from a pool of 26 unique genotypes planted in a large common garden experiment. Details about the establishment of this common garden are given in @CITATION. These 10 genotypes displayed substantial variation in a variety of plant traits FIGURES FOR SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL. Shoot cuttings were soaked in water overnight and then planted in a mixture of 80% perlite, 20% peat moss and ___ dolomite lime inside 'cone-tainers'. We grew cuttings under ambient weather conditions outside the greenhouse at Humboldt State University.

In late May 2012, we planted 200 willow cuttings in a split-plot experimental design at Lanphere Dunes.  At 10 different willow patches (blocks), we established an 'exposed' and 'unexposed' common garden. Each garden consisted of one replicate cutting of each of 10 genotypes randomly planted in _ x _ grid with __ cm spacing between plants. The center of exposed and unexposed gardens within each block were the same distance (1.5 m?) from the edge of the willow patch to control for insect accessability; however, exposed gardens faced prevailing winds during the growing season.

##Local Site Characteristics
Wind exposure may alter local site characteristics such as soil nutrients as well as the rest of the plant community. Therefore, we characterized these aspects to identify the direct and indirect effects of wind exposure.

We used a 5TE soil sensor (Decagon Devices - Pullman, Washington, USA) to measure soil volumetric water content (m^3^/m^3^), temperature (C), and electrical conductivity (dS/m). We characterized the soil on 3 different days in early July, 2013 between 1130 and 1500 hrs.

Soil Measurements

At the end of the growing season (September 17 – 28) in 2012, we measured X aspects of the soil, including: X nutrients, total organic matter content, moisture, temperature, and electrical conductivity.

To measure nutrient availability in the soil, we used Plant Root Simulator (PRS) Probes (Western Ag Innovations, Saskatchewan, Canada).  We installed PRS probes at 3 randomly selected locations within each site for 11 days.

To measure total organic matter content (TOM), we used a trowel to collect soil at a depth up to 15 cm adjacent to the randomly positioned PRS probes on Sep 18, 2012.  Soils were transported back to the lab in plastic bags, sieved into fragments less than 2 mm, randomly subsampled using a soil splitter, and dried at an average temperature of 105 degrees Celsius for X days.  We then weighed a subsample of the oven dried soil into an oven dried crucible and placed the crucible and soil into a furnace to be combusted at XX degrees Celsius for X days.  We then weighed the combusted samples, placed them in a desiccator for 20 minutes, reweighed them.  To calculate total organic matter we used the equation: TOM = (Oven Dry Weight -Combusted Weight)/Oven Dry Weight.

We used an EM50 Digital/Analog Data Logger (Decagon Devices, Washington, USA) to measure soil moisture, temperature, and electrical conductivity at a soil depth of about 5 cm.  We measured soil moisture at 3 random locations within each site on three different days while PRS probes were in the ground.  All readings occurred between GIVE HOURS.


###Soil
In September 2012, we established soil probes to characterize nutrient availability at each site. 

We also collected soil to characterize organic matter content of the different sites.

In addition, we measured soil moisture, temperature, and electrical conductivity in September 2012 and MONTH 2013.

###Plant community
In MONTH 2013, we surveyed the percent cover of other members of the plant community growing in the sites.


##Plant Traits
*Plant Productivity*: To quantify variation in plant productivity, we monitored total shoot growth over two growing seasons.  We quantified total shoot growth by measuring every shoot on each plant to the nearest millimeter and summing the total shoot growth for each plant during each survey.  We surveyed plants X times over the course of two growing seasons.

*Plant Height*: During plant productivity surveys, we also measured plant height.  We quantified plant height as the distance from the ground to the end of the tallest shoot to the nearest millimeter. ALSO MEASURE ORIGINAL PLANT HEIGHT AND MEASURE THE DIFFERENCE IN PLANT HEIGHT OVER THE GROWING SEASONS.

*Plant Quality*: We measured plant quality in several ways.  First, we have correlational data on the concentration of 29 phenolic glycosides, total condensed tannins and carbon:nitrogen ratios and the abundance of one of a dominant herbivore Caloptilia pruniella that specializes on willows from the willow common garden in which we took cuttings from.  We knew that *Caloptilia pruniella* abundance varied across these genotypes [NEED TO CONTROL FOR PLANT SIZE AND CONVERT TO DENSITY] so we looked for correlations between these plant traits and the abundance of this herbivore.  Furthermore, we examined whether the rank average abundance of *C. pruniella* on these 10 genotypes in the common garden matched our observed variation in *C. pruniella* abundance on genotypes in unexposed plots.

Second, we conducted leaf quality assays using Spodoptera exigua. NEED TO WORK ON METHODS.  SEE SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS OF CRUTSINGER ET AL. 2006.  FILL OUT PERMIT NOW!  In May 2012, we picked a single leaf from each plant and allowed a randomly chosen *Spodoptera exigua* larva to feed on the leaf in a petri dish for 5 days.  We used wet body mass at the end of 5 days as our measure of larva performance and consequently plant quality (i.e. small larva = low quality plant tissue).  

Lastly, we measured several other plant traits that may influence plant tissue quality, including: specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, trichome density, and percent leaf desiccation (i.e. browned portion at end of leaf tip).  To measure these traits, we picked a single fully expanded leaf that appeared to be of the highest quality for that plant (method in summer of 2011).

I WILL ALSO COLLECT LEAVES TO EXAMINE C:N CONTENT ACROSS ALL MY PLANTS.

**Arthropod Food Web**
We quantified arthropod food webs in ____ ways: (1) herbivore and predator/parasitoid abundance, species richness, and rarefied richness, (2) genotype-herbivore network dissimilarity, (3) herbivore-parasitoid network dissimilarity, (4) arthropod community dissimilarity, and (5) average? food chain length.

To do this, we visually surveyed plants for arthropods and enumerated the abundances of each morphospecies on four different occassions from July 2012 - 2013.  We created the links within the food web in two ways.  For parasitoids, we collected leaf mining, leaf tiering and galling insects and reared them to determine whether they were parasitized.  [MAKE A NOTE OF THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF THESE COMPARED TO OTHER HERBIVORES].  For spiders and ants, we created links if they co-occured with potential prey on a given survey.  We specified potential prey based on our observations from our visual surveys as well as searching the primary literature. [MAY ONLY USE THE HOST-PARASITOID DATA FOR THE NETWORK STUFF, BUT THE SPIDER AND ANT INFO COULD BE USEFUL FOR THE FOOD CHAIN LENGTH DATA].
