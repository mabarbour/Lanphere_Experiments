<div class="ltx_p"><b>Table 1:</b> Net effect sizes of heritable trait variation, phenotypic plasticity, and direct environmental effects on community structure. Values represent the sum of effect sizes calculated across different pathways of the structural equation models (Fig. 2 and 3). Note that effects sizes include significant missing pathways (e.g. dotted lines in Fig. 2).</div>
