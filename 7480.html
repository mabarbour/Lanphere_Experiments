<div class="ltx_p">A key challenge for advancing studies of community genetics beyond the
common garden is to identify important biotic and abiotic environmental
factors that structure communities associated with host plants. For
example, a series of experiments in common milkweed (<i>Asclepias
syriaca</i>) have shown that a diversity of biotic factors, such as light
competition from neighboring plants <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Agrawal_2003}</cite>, caterpillar
herbivory <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Abdala_Roberts_2012}</cite>, and aphid-tending
ants&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mooney_2008}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Abdala_Roberts_2012}</cite> can act
independently or interact with milkweed genotype to shape its associated
community of foliar arthropods. Similarly, abiotic factors, such as soil
nutrient availability, can act independently or modify the effects of
host-plant genotype on herbivore assemblages <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Orians_1996}</cite> and
tri-trophic interactions <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Rossi_1998}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Abdala_Roberts_2012a}</cite>. Still, we are lacking explicit comparisons of host-plant
genotypic effects across natural gradients in both biotic and abiotic
factors, so their relative importance in structuring communities is
unclear.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">Although host plants provide essential resources for a diverse array of
taxa both above- and belowground, the majority of community genetics
studies have focused on aboveground assemblages <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Whitham_2012}</cite>. Studies that have simultaneously examined above- and belowground
communities have found variable results, with host-plant genetic effects
on aboveground communities being stronger <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Crutsinger_2008}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Bailey_2009}</cite> or comparable and coupled <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Crutsinger_2014}</cite> with those belowground. Above- and belowground
linkages can have important consequences for both plant fitness <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Whitham_2006}</cite> and terrestrial ecosystem processes <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Wardle_2004}</cite>. In addition, feedbacks between above- and belowground
assemblages may depend strongly on the biotic and/or abiotic environment <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Wardle_2004}</cite>. Consequently, a rising challenge for
community genetics is to understand the linkages between above- and
belowground communities <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Crutsinger_2014}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lamit_2015}</cite> and whether these linkages are modified by environmental
variation.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">Host-plant traits determine the quantity and quality of resources for
the diverse organisms that colonize them; therefore, measuring
functional trait responses of host-plant genotypes to different
environments can give insight to mechanisms of community assembly in
genotype-by-environment studies. Phenotypic traits can vary in their
plasticity (change in trait expression of a genotype in response to the
environment: <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Scheiner_1993}</cite>) and may even be plastic in response to one
environmental gradient but not another <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Scheiner_1993}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Scheiner_1984}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Garbutt_1987}</cite>. In addition, multiple plant
traits can be important in structuring associated communities on host
plants <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Barbour_2015}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Barbour_2016}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Agrawal_2006}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{agrawal2005natural}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Agrawal_2004}</cite>. Simultaneous measurements of multiple functional traits and
community-level patterns in genotype-by-environment studies can
distinguish the effects of heritable trait variation (proportion of
variance in a trait explained by genotype: <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{lynch1998genetics}</cite>),
phenotypic plasticity, and direct environmental effects on species
assemblages.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">Here, we use common garden experiments to examine how host-plant
genotypic variation as well as the biotic and abiotic environment
structure communities associated with the willow Salix hookeriana
in a coastal dune ecosystem. Prior work in this system has shown that
willow genotypes host distinct arthropod communities and that multiple
plant traits are important in determining community assembly <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Barbour_2015}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Barbour_2016}</cite>. Importantly, these traits varied
substantially in their degree of heritability (plant growth, mean <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(H^2\)</span>= 0.26; leaf quality, mean <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(H^2\)</span> = 0.72), suggesting that the environment may
influence them in different ways. We sought to answer the following
questions: (1) What is the relative importance of willow genotype vs.
the biotic and abiotic environment in structuring aboveground
communities? (2) Do willow genetic and environmental variation have
different effects on above and belowground communities? (3) What is the
relative importance of heritable trait variation, phenotypic plasticity,
and direct environmental effects in structuring communities?</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Materials and Methods</h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Study
site</h2><div class="ltx_p">We conducted this research at Lanphere Dunes (40<b>°</b> 53’29.85”N,
124<b>°</b> 8’49.06”W), a pristine coastal dune ecosystem managed by
US Fish and Wildlife service in Humboldt County, California, USA.
Coastal willow (<i>Salix hookeriana</i> ex Barratt ex Hooker) naturally
occurs in nearshore dune swales – seasonal freshwater wetlands that
form in depressions between dune ridges <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{pickart2007beach}</cite>. Aside from
coastal willow (hereafter willow), the dominant vegetation in these
swales consists of beach pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i> ssp. <i>contorta</i>) and slough sedge (<i>Carex obnupta</i>).</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">During preliminary surveys, we qualitatively identified two important
sources of environmental variation for willows in the dunes – one
biotic (the presence of ant-aphid mutualisms) and one abiotic (wind
exposure). We observed that the aphid <i>Aphis farinosa</i> was an
abundant herbivore at Lanphere Dunes. Aphis farinosa is usually
found at the tips of new shoot growth where it feeds on willow phloem.
As with many other aphid species, <i>A. farinosa</i> excretes
carbohydrate-rich honeydew while feeding, which attracts ants that tend
the aphids and feed on the honeydew. This ant-aphid interaction is often
mutualistic, because the ants will defend aphids from predatory
arthropods and also eat other herbivores that may be competing with the
aphids <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Floate_1994}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mooney_2008}</cite>. The ant species
we observed most frequently tending <i>A. farinosa</i> was the western
thatching ant, <i>Formica obscuripes</i>. Western thatching ants create
distinct dome-shaped mounds from nearby plant-material and are known to
reduce herbivory from leaf chewing arthropods on <i>S. hookeriana</i> at
our study site&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{CRUTSINGER_2005}</cite>, presumably by deterring
ovipositing females or predating young larva. This work suggests that
the presence of aphids and the proximity to ant mounds influences
associated communities through three non-mutually exclusive mechanisms:
(i) increased abundance of aphid-tending ants, which could deter other
arthropods; (ii) attraction of predators or deterrence of other
herbivores, by aphids; (iii) alteration of plant-growth or leaf quality
traits by aphids. We also observed that willows growing in wind-exposed
habitats often exhibit reduced growth, especially at their leading edge,
appearing to be “swept back” by the wind. We hypothesized that wind
exposure may influence associated communities through three non-mutually
exclusive mechanisms: (i) reduced plant size due to wind pruning; (ii)
altered soil characteristics due to increased evaporation; and (iii)
direct inhibition of ovipositing female arthropods.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Experimental
design</h2><div>Prior to bud break in February 2012, we took shoot cuttings (40 cm
length &amp; ~0.5 cm diameter) from one to two replicates
of 10 different willow genotypes from a pool of 26 locally collected
willow genotypes planted in a large common garden experiment. Details
about the establishment of this common garden are given in <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Barbour_2015}</cite>. These 10 genotypes displayed substantial variation
in both plant-growth and leaf-quality traits <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Barbour_2015}</cite>. Shoot cuttings were soaked in water overnight and then planted in
a mixture of 80% perlite, 20% peat moss (dolomite lime added to
balance pH) inside “Cone-tainers”™ (Stuewe &amp; Sons, Inc.). We grew
cuttings under ambient weather conditions outside the greenhouse at
Humboldt State University until we transplanted willows into multiple
common gardens at Lanphere Dunes.</div><div></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Ant-aphid experiment</h3><div>To examine how the presence of aphids, proximity to ant mounds, and
willow genotype affected associated communities, we established common
gardens around 5 different ant mounds (treated as blocks) in late May
2012. Within each block, we randomly planted 20 cuttings (2 replicates
of each of 10 genotypes) with 0.5 m spacing in plots that were at a
distance of 1, 6, and 12 meters from the edge of the ant mound, for a
total of 60 cuttings per ant mound (300 cuttings for entire experiment).
Within each plot, we randomly assigned the aphid treatment (aphid
presence vs. absence) to one of the two replicates for each genotype. On
May 22, we collected aphids (<i>Aphis farinosa</i>) from a single willow
patch at Lanphere Dunes and placed 5 adult apterate aphids on the tips
of willow cuttings in the aphid treatment using a moist paintbrush. We
bagged aphids onto the apical shoots of cuttings using organza bags to
promote aphid establishment on plants. Similarly, we placed organza bags
on all control plants. On May 27, we checked aphid treatments to ensure
there were 5 adult aphids and removed bags from all cuttings. If
necessary, we added aphids to these treatments until there were 5 adults
and we removed any aphid nymphs that were produced since initial
establishment. We checked plants for aphids on June 6, June 13, June 24,
July 4, July 14, and July 20, 2012. If plants in the aphid treatment had
less than 5 apterate aphids, we noted their abundance and added aphids
until there were at least 5 individuals. The ant-aphid experiment was
restricted to the summer of 2012, because in the summer of 2013 there
was high willow mortality induced by drought and A. farinosa was
too low in abundance on naturally occurring willows to allow us to
repeat the experiment.</div><div></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Wind experiment</h3><div class="ltx_p">To examine how wind exposure and willow genotype affected associated
communities in the coastal dunes, we planted 200 willow cuttings in a
split-plot experimental design in late May of 2012. At each of 10
different willow patches (treated as blocks), we established an
‘exposed’ and a ‘unexposed’ common garden with exposed gardens facing
prevailing winds during the growing season. Each garden consisted of one
replicate cutting of each of 10 genotypes randomly planted in 2 m by 0.5
m grid with 0.5 m spacing between plants. The center of exposed and
unexposed gardens within each block were the same distance (2 m) from
the edge of the willow patch to control for insect accessibility. To
estimate the difference in wind conditions experienced by exposed vs.
unexposed plants, we went out on a representative windy afternoon in
September 2012. A nearby weather station estimated wind speeds of 22
km/h during this period (Arcata, CA). We used a hand-held anemometer
(Kestrel 1000) to measure wind speed at a height of 37 cm aboveground
(approximate height of tallest plants in the garden in 2012) in each
plot of our experiment. For each block, we randomly selected the order
in which exposed and unexposed plots were measured and took maximum wind
speed measurements over a 30 s period. We found that willows growing in
wind-exposed plots experienced up to 3.7-fold higher wind speeds
compared to unexposed plots (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(F_{1,9}=187.32,\ P&lt;0.001\)</span>) (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(F_{1,9}\)</span> = 187.32, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), suggesting that the location of our plots were
effective manipulations of wind exposure.</div>
