<b>Table S2:</b> Summary of abundance responses of key arthropod
guilds in the ant-aphid experiment. We analyzed all of these responses
using generalized linear mixed-effect models (error distribution =
Poisson, link function = log). We report the likelihood-ratio test
statistic and include the degrees of freedom for each test as a
subscript next to each predictor.</div>
