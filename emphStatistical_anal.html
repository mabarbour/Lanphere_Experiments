<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Statistical analyses</h2><div class="ltx_p">willow genotype, the environment, and their interaction, influenced
richness, abundance, and rarefied richness of aboveground arthropods as
well as rarefied richness of root fungi and bacteria, we used separate
generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMMs) <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Bolker_2009}</cite>. For the ant-aphid experiment, we omitted A. farinosa and
F. obscuripes from our calculations of arthropod community
properties because we expected our treatments to manipulate their
abundances. We specified block (ant mound) and plots nested within block
(the 3 different distances from ant mound) as random effects. We
specified willow genotype, aphid treatment, distance from ant mound, and
their 3-way interaction as fixed effects in the model. For the wind
experiment, we specified block (willow patch) and plots nested within
block (the 2 wind exposure treatments) as random effects. We specified
willow genotype, wind treatment, sampling year, and their 3-way
interaction as fixed effects in the model. Plant mortality in each
experiment resulted in unbalanced designs, so we used Type II
sum-of-squares to test the significance of fixed effects. For continuous
responses (rarefied richness) we specified Gaussian error distributions
in our models and tested the significance of fixed effects using F-tests
with Kenward-Roger approximated degrees of freedom. For count responses
(richness and arthropod abundances), we specified Poisson error
distributions in our models and tested the significance of fixed effects
using likelihood-ratio tests. If necessary, we accounted for
overdispersion in these Poisson models by specifying an individual-level
random effect.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">To examine whether community composition depended on willow genotype,
the environment, or their interaction, we applied a Hellinger
transformation to our community data (square root of proportional
abundance of species found on each willow; <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Legendre_2001}</cite> and conducted separate redundancy analyses (RDA, 1000 permutations on
Euclidean distances) for the arthropod, fungal, and bacterial
communities. A Hellinger transformation was appropriate because
calculating Euclidean distances on raw abundance data can sometimes
result in two communities that do not share the same species being more
similar than two communities that do share the same species <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Legendre_2001}</cite>. We incorporated the same fixed-effects model structure
as we used to analyze the univariate community responses for each
experiment. To test the significance of each effect, we used Type II
sum-of-squares and compared the observed community dissimilarities to
the dissimilarities we would expect by random chance with a permutation
test that controls for the blocked design of our experiment. To test the
significance of treatments that varied at the plot-level (wind exposure
and distance from ant mound), we first calculated the community’s
centroid in multivariate space for each plot. We then included block as
a covariate and ran the same permutation test as previously described.
This ensured that our significance tests of treatments that varied at
the plot-level were based on the appropriate residual degrees of freedom
(wind exposure residual <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(df=9\)</span>; distance from ant mound residual <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(df=4\)</span>).</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">To compare the relative importance of willow genotype vs. different
environmental factors, we fit reduced GLMMs with significant factors as
random effects. We then used the variance components estimated for these
random effects to calculate the percentage of variance (hereafter <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\sigma^2\)</span>) explained by willow genotype and specific
environmental factors. This method has been proposed as appropriate for
comparing the relative importance of plant genotype and the environment
in genotype-by-environment studies <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Johnson_2005}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Hersch_Green_2011}</cite>. For models of community composition, we fit
reduced RDAs with only significant factors and calculated the adjusted
redundancy statistic for each significant factor, which has been shown
to be unbiased estimator of explained variance <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Peres_Neto_2006}</cite>.
This adjusted redundancy statistic is an analogue of adjusted <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(R^2\)</span> but for multivariate responses and we refer
to it hereafter as <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(R^2_{adj}\)</span>.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Plant
traits</h3><div>To analyze how willow genotype, the environment, and their
interaction, influenced willow phenotypes, we used separate GLMMs with
the same structure described in the “Community responses” section. For
the wind experiment, we lacked multiple years of data on leaf trichome
density (2012 only), SLA (2013 only), leaf C:N (2013 only), and root C:N
(2013 only); therefore, we removed sampling year, and its interactions,
from the fixed effects structures of these
GLMMs.</div><div></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection"><div>Soil
characteristics</div></h3><div>To examine the effect of wind exposure on soil
characteristics (total N, nutrients PC1, %OM, and soil moisture), we
used separate mixed effect models with wind treatment as a fixed effect
and block (willow patch) as a random effect. Since all soil
characteristics were continuous responses, we specified Gaussian error
distributions in our models and tested the significance of fixed effects
using F-tests with Kenward-Roger approximated degrees of
freedom.</div><div></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Heritable
trait variation vs. phenotypic plasticity vs. direct environmental
effects</h3><div>To identify potential mechanisms by which willow genetic and
environmental variation affects community responses, we used piecewise
structural equation models (SEMs)<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lefcheck_2015}</cite>. We only modeled
potential mechanisms and community responses that were statistically
significant in our prior analyses. For example, if we did not observe a <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(G\times E\)</span> effect on a community response variable, then we did not model this
interactive effect in the piecewise SEM. An advantage of piecewise SEMs is that they are flexible, allowing users
to account for correlated structure (i.e. random effects) in their
experimental design. However, as with any technique that relies on
multiple regression, structural equation models can give misleading
results if there is collinearity among predictor variables. To mitigate
the effects of collinearity, we used principal components analysis (PCA)
to condense aboveground willow phenotypes as well as soil properties
into a small number of uncorrelated variables. For aboveground willow
traits in the wind experiment, we analyzed separate PCAs for 2012 and
2013 since we did not always have data on the same traits in each year.
At times, we lacked data for all traits on each plant or all soil
properties measured in each plot. Therefore, we used a regularized
iterative PCA algorithm to impute missing values <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{josse2012handling}</cite>. For each PCA, we retained principal components with eigenvalues
greater than 1.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><div class="ltx_p">To calculate standardized coefficients in our piecewise SEM, we scaled
all predictor and response variables to mean = 0 and SD = 1 prior to
analyzing them with GLMMs (error distribution = Gaussian). For willow
genotype, we specified the average effect for the 10 genotypes as the
reference level (i.e. deviation contrasts) and calculated the standard
deviation of the coefficients to determine its standardized coefficient.
We then multiplied standardized coefficients across a given pathway to
calculate the strength of each mechanism we modelled. To evaluate the
explanatory power of our separate GLMMs, we report marginal <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(R^2\)</span><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Nakagawa_2012}</cite>. Marginal <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(R^2\)</span> values do not adjust for the variance
explained by our random effects; therefore, they give us a truer sense
of the explanatory power of our models. To evaluate the fit of the full
structural equation model, we used a test of directed separation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{shipley2000new}</cite>. This test identifies missing paths in the model,
calculates the P-value for each missing pathway, and then
calculates a test statistic, Fisher’s <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(C\)</span>, using the following
equation: <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(C=-2\times\ln\left(P_i\right)\)</span>, where <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(P_i\)</span> is the <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(P\)</span>-value of the ith missing pathway. Fisher’s C can then be
compared to a chi-square distribution with 2k degrees of freedom, where k is the total number of missing pathways.
If there are many missing pathways with low P-values, this will
result in a lower P-value for the structural equation model.
Therefore, a P-value &lt; 0.05 indicates a poor fit for
the structural equation model, whereas a P-value &gt;
0.05 indicates a good fit. Note that if we have included the key plant
traits as well as biotic and abiotic factors, then there should be no
missing paths between willow genotype and our environmental treatments.</div><div class="ltx_p">All analyses were conducted in R version 3.2.4 <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{R2016}</cite>.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div>What is the relative importance of
willow genotype vs. the biotic and abiotic environment in structuring
aboveground
communities?</div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Ant-aphid
experiment</h3><div>Willow genotype tended to be more important than the
biotic environment in structuring the arthropod community (Table S1 in
Supporting Information). We found that arthropod richness varied from
1.2 to 3.2 species among genotypes (𝜎2 = 11%,
χ9 = 41.35, P &lt; 0.001), while arthropod
abundance varied 4-fold among the different clones (Fig. 1A;
𝜎2 = 7%, χ9 = 34.86, P &lt;
0.001). The effect of willow genotype on arthropod richness was
explained by correlated responses in arthropod abundance, as there was
no difference in rarefied richness among genotypes
(F9,138.8 = 0.83, P = 0.586). Aphid treatment was the
only factor that affected rarefied richness (𝜎2 = 4%,
F1,139.2 = 5.34, P = 0.022), resulting in a 16%
decrease in rarefied richness when aphids were added to willows (Fig.
1C); however, this effect of aphid treatment did not translate into an
effect on total richness (χ1 = 0.45, P = 0.504). Willows
in the aphid treatment also had 2-fold more arthropods, but only at the
furthest distance from ant mounds (Fig. 1Bt,
𝜎2 = 9%, χ1 = 8.12, P = 0.004).
Proximity to ant mounds did not influence any other aspect of the
arthropod community (Table S1). In contrast to richness and abundance
responses, arthropod community composition was influenced by an
interaction between willow genotype and the aphid treatment (Fig. 2A; <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(R_{adj}^2=6\%,\ F_{9,157}=1.45,\ P=0.022\)</span>). This G<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\times\)</span>E effect was primarily due to the differential
response of other aphids to a single willow genotype (Fig. 2A solid
line; Table S2). If we remove this genotype from the analysis, we find
independent effects on community composition, with the effect of willow
genotype 3%, 1.66, 0.007 (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(R_{adj}^2=3\%,\ F_{8,156}=1.66,\ P=0.007\)</span>) being relatively more
important than the addition of aphids
(<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(R^2_{adj}\)</span> = 1%,
F1,156 = 2.93, P = 0.017).</div>
