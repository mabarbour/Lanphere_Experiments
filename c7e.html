<div>In contrast to previous work <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Johnson_2008}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mooney_2008}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mooney_2008}</cite>, we found that the effects of host-plant genotype on the richness and abundance of other arthropods were mediated, in part, by genotypic differences in plant size rather than ant abundance. One possible reason for this discrepancy is that the absolute variation in <i>F. obscuripes</i> abundance was quite low in our experiment (max. genotype average = ~0.5 individuals) compared to other studies (max. genotype average = ~3 individuals), which was likely due to the rather low abundance of aphids we observed (max. genotype average = 7 individuals). While we failed to fully identify the mechanisms (likely unmeasured plant traits) explaining arthropod community responses in this experiment, our results do suggest that host-plant evolution could have strong effects on arthropod community structure, despite variability in this biotic factor.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Wind experiment</h3><div>Our study supports the notion that wind is a key environmental factor in structuring communities associated with host plants in coastal dune ecosystems <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Miller_1999}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Crutsinger_2010}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Crutsinger_2014}</cite>. We found that the negative effects of wind exposure on arthropod richness and abundance resulted from a combination of direct effects on colonization as well as indirect effects mediated by wind pruning and, to a lesser extent, reductions in leaf quality. Similarly, Crutsinger et al. (2014) found that there were more arthropod species and individuals on prostrate vs. erect morphs of coyote bush (Baccharis piluaris), due to their low-lying growth form which enabled them to be more productive than erect morphs at their windy coastal dunes site.</div><div></div><div class="ltx_p">Few studies have examined community-level responses to natural variability in the abiotic environment and host-plant genetic variation, making it difficult to draw other useful comparisons. The majority of genotype-by-abiotic environment studies to date have used fertilizers to manipulate soil nutrient availability (Abdala-Roberts &amp; Mooney 2013, Orians &amp; Fritz 1996, Ross &amp; Stiling 1998), but it is unclear whether these manipulations reflect natural variation in soil nutrients. This may explain why the effects of variation in soil nutrients range from being independent and weak (Abdala-Roberts &amp; Mooney 2013) to being strong modifiers (Orians &amp; Fritz 1996) of host-plant genotype on arthropod communities. The only other genotype-by-abiotic environment study that we are aware of manipulated sun exposure by sea daisy (Borrichia frutescens, Ross &amp; Stiling 1998) and, similar to our study, observed strong, independent effects of sun exposure on densities of the gall midge, Asphondylia borrichiae, presumably through changes in carbon-based secondary metabolites. If we are to make progress on understanding the relative importance of willow genotype vs. environment for associated communities, future experimental work should focus on manipulating natural variation in specific abiotic factors, or, at the very least, measuring variability in abiotic factors to begin to identify putative causal factors.</div><div class="ltx_p"></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Conclusions</h2><div>Overall, our study reinforces the importance of host-plant genetic variation in shaping associated communities and extends this finding to natural biotic and abiotic gradients in coastal dune ecosystems. Our findings also suggest that predicting community responses to genetic and environmental variation is a complex task that may depend on historical processes that have shaped the genetic architecture for the populations of interest (i.e. sensitivity to specific environmental factors). Still, the effects of willow genetic variation were clear at both the level of plant traits and the community structure of foliar arthropods and fungi. Importantly, this suggests that host-plant evolution could have a strong influence on the biodiversity of above and belowground communities. Future studies should work toward understanding how these diverse communities feedback to impose selection pressures on host plants as well as how host-plant traits mediate interactions between above and belowground communities. In doing so, we will be able to work toward a more synthetic understanding of the evolutionary ecology of host plants and their diverse associated communities.</div><div></div>
