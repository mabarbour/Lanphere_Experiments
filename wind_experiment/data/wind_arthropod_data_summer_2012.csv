"# this data was copied and pasted from the original excel file. I deleted all of the plant trait data to focus on the arthropods.  I then transferred all of the arthropod data from the notes section into new columns of data.  Had to move some of the notes to the appropriate row because they were typed in out of sequence with ""other arthropods"".  Note that just because there is a zero for ""other arthropods"" doesn't mean there couldn't have been arthropod data entered in the notes (inaccuracy in transcribing data in the field). For the new data added from the notes column, I replaced all blank values with zeros, because that is what they actually reflect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Genotype,Block,Wind Exposure,Plant Position,Unique Number,Black Ants,Red ants,Spiders black with yellow legs,Spiders Other,Incomplete LTF,Leaf Hoppers Blue/Brown,Leaf Hoppers Camo,LH nymph blk/ylw,LH nymph other,Light Green Aphids,Parisatoid cocoons on Aphids,Green Aphids,Orange Aphids,Other Arthropods,sawfly_eggs,striped_sawfly,stem_gall,volcano_gall,mite_gall,yellow_knife_leaf_hopper,twisty_gall,giant_willow_aphid,psyllid,psyllid_nymph,sawfly_larva,unknown_eggs,spider_disk_egg_sac,fluffy_spider_egg_sac,Dead?,NotesI,1,Exposed,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7/22/12 started block 2 at 9:50.   %100 brown tipsW,1,Exposed,2,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10 leaves have %50 damageF,1,Exposed,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,all browned leavesL,1,Exposed,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,all browned leaf tipsT,1,Exposed,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,all browned leavesX,1,Exposed,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"3 shoots dead above, not collected"J,1,Exposed,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1 sawfly egg, all browned leaves"S,1,Exposed,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,all browned leavesU,1,Exposed,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,both leaves brownedG,1,Exposed,10,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5 leaves with %50+ damageW,1,Unexposed,1,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"furry egg sack, pic at 16:00, 12 sawfly eggs, half of leaves have brown tips"F,1,Unexposed,2,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,most leaves with browned tipsI,1,Unexposed,3,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,L,1,Unexposed,4,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"few brown tips, "T,1,Unexposed,5,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,.5 cm new shootX,1,Unexposed,6,16,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,mostly brown tipsS,1,Unexposed,7,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,U,1,Unexposed,8,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,J,1,Unexposed,9,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,G,1,Unexposed,10,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"half of leaves have %30+ damage, pic taken at 16:27"W,2,Exposed,1,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,all browned at tipsF,2,Exposed,2,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,I,2,Exposed,3,23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,L,2,Exposed,4,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,T,2,Exposed,5,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,X,2,Exposed,6,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,S,2,Exposed,7,27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,U,2,Exposed,8,28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,J,2,Exposed,9,29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,G,2,Exposed,10,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,W,2,Unexposed,1,31,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,former height of 27I,2,Unexposed,2,32,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2 spider disk egg sacks F,2,Unexposed,3,33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,L,2,Unexposed,4,34,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,"brown LH, 2 unknown eggs pic taken at 10:18 -
