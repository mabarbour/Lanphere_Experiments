"# all of the data from the original excel file was copied into here so I could easily make new columns for each category of relevant data. For ""white disc egg sacs"" I counted them as one, even if they had multiple eggs inside. Code of ""LT"" denotes only that this column of data comes from the ""leaf tie"" data set, which may include arthropods other than leaf tiers.  There are currently WAY too many categories than there should be. I also altered the category name for ""Treatments"" to match my ""Wind Exposure"" column for my visual survey of arthropods. Made leaf damage categories for LMF (leaf middle fold), LER (leaf edge roll) and LB (leaf bundle, various types included) in order to compare abundance/damage across years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Experiment,Treatment,Block,Plant,Leaf,Morpho Dam,Contents,Questionable Morpho,leaf_dam_LER,leaf_dam_LB,leaf_dam_LMF,LT_white_disk_egg_sac,LT_sp_328,LT_dead_unknown_larva,LT_dead_319,LT_dead_320,empty_LT,other_LT,empty_343_pupa_LT,empty_352,empty_with_frass_LT,live_320_LT,sp_327_LT,F_sp_203_LT,frass_some_silk_LT,fresh_but_stiff_336_LT,dead_fresh_320_321,LB_moth_pupa_LT,live_larva_unknown_morphospecies_LT,sp_126_LT,living_319_LT,living_320_LT,living_320_321_LT,living_321_LT,living_322,living_343_LT,living_350,living_391,living_sawfly_LT,other_tent_mine_pupa,parasitized?_LT,sp_327_LT,letter_T_moth_LT,unknown_larva_LT,white_parasitoid_LT,possible_327_cocoon_LT,possible_328,Notesw,Exposed,3,2,7,entire LER,empty,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,w,Exposed,3,2,8,LER,empty with frass,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,w,Exposed,3,2,unk,,living 322,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,*w,Exposed,3,2,unk,,living 322,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,* given garbage leaves to eatw,Exposed,3,2,unk,,living 322,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,*w,Unexposed,2,1,1,LER,empty with frass,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"leaf totally browned, small hole in silk"w,Unexposed,2,2,223,white disk,16 spiders,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,spiders had emerged into bagw,Unexposed,2,2,1,white disk,spider eggs,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,w,Unexposed,2,2,2,LB,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,leaf bundle looks very ragged and chewedw,Unexposed,2,2,unk 1,,living 320,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,*HUGE! 15.8 mm extendedw,Unexposed,2,2,unk 2,,living 319,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"*same bag, given leaves"w,Exposed,2,7,3,LER,empty,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,w,Exposed,2,7,4+5,LB,living 319,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,w,Exposed,2,3,1,LB/LLER,dead 320,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sandwich bundle (2 leaves)w,Unexposed,8,8,8,white disk,empty,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"what looks like a long LER with larva inside, has 2 leaves sandwiched onto it."w,Unexposed,8,5,1,LER,living 319,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,w,Unexposed,8,5,2,12,empty,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,w,Unexposed,8,5,3,12,empty,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,w,Unexposed,8,5,3,12,living 319,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,w,Unexposed,8,5,3,LER,living 320,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,nape is very fadedw,Exposed,5,6,1,12,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,w,Exposed,4,5,9,LB,living 320,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sanwich bundlew,Exposed,1,7,3,,living 350,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,a 'baby' tick was collected from this treew,Exposed,1,6,3,LB,living 320,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"sandwich with 18"" shoot terminal (aka ""leaf inside"")"w,Exposed,1,3,1,hybrid,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,round hole at tip (definitely  chewed out) 1 head molt seenw,Exposed,1,3,2,entire LER,sp. 327 empty cocoon,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,leaf clinching only extends halfway down leafw,Exposed,1,4,1,MGL2,empty 343 pupa,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Matt took pic with silk on.
