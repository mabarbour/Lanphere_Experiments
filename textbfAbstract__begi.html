For example, genetic variation in the leaf chemistry of&nbsp;cottonwoods <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Whitham_2006}</cite> and in the plant architecture of coyote bush <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Crutsinger_2014}</cite> structures diverse assemblages of species, from foliar arthropods aboveground to soil microbes below. While community-level consequences of genetic variation (commonly referred to as ‘community genetics’, sensu&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{antonovics1992toward}</cite>) have been documented in a variety of host-plant taxa <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Whitham_2012}</cite>, evidence comes primarily from common garden experiments that minimize environmental variation. These controlled environments likely limit effects of the biotic and abiotic environment on the expression of host plant traits <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Gratani_2014}</cite> as well as the diversity and composition of species assemblages <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{macarthur1972geographical}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Gaston_2000}</cite>. Therefore, the importance of host-plant genetic variation in structuring ecological communities in naturally varying environments remains unclear <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Hersch_Green_2011}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Tack_2011}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Crutsinger_2015}</cite>.</div><div></div>
