Most evidence supporting this view is derived from studies within a single common garden, thereby constraining the range of biotic and abiotic environmental conditions that might directly or indirectly (via phenotypic plasticity) affect communities. If natural variability in the environment renders host-plant genetic effects on associated communities unimportant, then studying the community-level consequences of genetic variation may not be warranted.</li><li>We addressed this knowledge gap by planting a series of common gardens consisting of 10 different clones (genotypes) of the willow Salix hookeriana in a coastal dune ecosystem and manipulated natural variation in ant-aphid interactions (biotic) and wind exposure (abiotic) in two separate experiments. We then quantified the responses of associated species assemblages both above (foliar arthropods) and belowground (rhizosphere fungi and bacteria). In addition, we quantified plant phenotypic responses (plant growth, leaf quality, and root quality) to tease apart the effects of heritable trait variation, phenotypic plasticity, and direct environmental effects on associated communities.</li><li>In the ant-aphid experiment, we found that willow genotype explained more variation in foliar arthropod communities than aphid additions and proximity to aphid-tending ant mounds. However, aphid additions modified willow genotype effects on arthropod community composition by attracting other aphid species to certain willow genotypes. In the wind experiment, wind exposure explained more variation than willow genotype in communities of foliar arthropods and root bacteria. Still, willow genotype had strong effect sizes on several community properties of arthropods and fungi, indicating that host-plant genetic variation remains important. In both experiments, plant-growth traits were the primary determinants of arthropod community structure with leaf quality traits playing a lesser role; however, we failed to identify which root traits were mediating belowground community responses.</li><li>Taken together, our results suggest that host-plant genetic variation is an important driver of above and belowground biodiversity, despite natural variation in the biotic and abiotic environment.</li><li></li></ol><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Intraspecific genetic variation is a key driver of trait variation within host plants, which in turn can have cascading effects on associated species and entire communities of organisms <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Fritz_1988}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lamit_2016}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Maddox_1990}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{antonovics1992toward}</cite>.
