Wind swept food webs
========================================================

Matthew A. Barbour and Gregory W. Crutsinger


Objectives
----------

To examine the interactive effects of willow genotype and wind exposure on arthropod food webs.


Introduction
------------

I. Evidence for plant genotype in shaping plant traits and arthropod community
- Plant genotype influences biomass production

II. Evidence for wind pruning in shaping plant traits and arthropod community
- Wind pruning may decrease primary productivity as well as the architecture of the plant.

**Research Questions**
1. What is the relative importance of plant genotype vs. environment in structuring arthropod food webs?  
2. What are the underlying mechanisms shaping variation in arthropod food web structure?  

**Hypotheses**
We hypothesized that both plant genotype and wind exposure would influence primary productivity and plant architecture.  In turn, we hypothesized that variation in primary productivity and plant architecture would influence both the size of arthropod food webs as well as food chain length.

**Network Hypotheses**
We hypothesized that wind exposure would decrease primary productivity, leaf tissue quality, and plant height.  We hypothesized that these changes in plant traits would decrease network size.  Finally, we hypothesized that the individual-based networks of plant genotypes in unexposed sites would be more dissimilar from each other than when they occur in exposed sites (i.e. the networks are homogenized).  

**John Chase Hypothesis**
I hypothesized that wind exposure would lead to a decrease in network size and make exposed sites more similar to each other, whereas networks at unexposed sites would be determined more by environmental stochasticity.


Methods
-------

**Study Site**
We conducted this research at Lanphere Dunes (40°53'29.85"N, 124° 8'49.06"W), a pristine coastal dune ecosystem managed by US Fish and Wildlife service in Humboldt County, California.  The willow *Salix hookeriana* naturally occurs in nearshore dune swales - seasonal freshwater wetlands that form in depressions between dune ridges (Pickart 2009).  Aside from our study species, the dominant vegetation in these swales consists of beach pine (*Pinus contorta* ssp. *contorta*) and slough sedge (*Carex obnupta*).  

**Experimental Design**
We planted 200 willow cuttings in a split-plot experimental design.  At 10 different willow patches (blocks), we established an 'exposed' and 'unexposed' common garden.  Exposed and unexposed gardens within each block were the same distance from the edge of the willow patch to control for insect accessability; however, exposed gardens faced prevailing winds during the growing season.  Each garden consisted of one replicate cutting of each of 10 genotypes randomly planted [GIVE SPATIAL DISTANCES BETWEEN PLANTS] (10 genotypes * 2 wind treatments * 10 blocks = 200 total cuttings).  GIVE INFORMATION ON THE MANNER IN WHICH PLANT TRAITS VARIED ACROSS GENOTYPES.  Details on methods for propogating willow cuttings are in the Supplementary Material.

**Plant Traits**


**Arthropod Food Web**
We quantified arthropod food webs in ____ ways: (1) herbivore and predator/parasitoid abundance, species richness, and rarefied richness, (2) genotype-herbivore network dissimilarity, (3) herbivore-parasitoid network dissimilarity, (4) arthropod community dissimilarity, and (5) average? food chain length.

To do this, we visually surveyed plants for arthropods and enumerated the abundances of each morphospecies on four different occassions from July 2012 - 2013.  We created the links within the food web in two ways.  For parasitoids, we collected leaf mining, leaf tiering and galling insects and reared them to determine whether they were parasitized.  [MAKE A NOTE OF THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF THESE COMPARED TO OTHER HERBIVORES].  For spiders and ants, we created links if they co-occured with potential prey on a given survey.  We specified potential prey based on our observations from our visual surveys as well as searching the primary literature. [MAY ONLY USE THE HOST-PARASITOID DATA FOR THE NETWORK STUFF, BUT THE SPIDER AND ANT INFO COULD BE USEFUL FOR THE FOOD CHAIN LENGTH DATA].

Supplementary Material
----------------------
*Propogation of willow cuttings*
Prior to bud burst in February 2012, we took cuttings from one replicate of each of the 10 genotypes used in this experiment that were taken from another common garden where we have replicates of 26 genetically distinct willow clones.  
We chose these 10 genotypes because they vary significantly in carbon-nitrogen ratios, LIST OTHER TRAITS

On February 21, 2012 [DOUBLE CHECK DATE] we sacrificed 1-2 replicates from 10 of 26 genotypes that varied significantly in leaf carbon:nitrogen ratios (NEED STATS), a putative trait that influences aphid performance.   COMMON GARDEN DETAILS.  We took cuttings from shoots grown in the previous year and soaked cuttings in water overnight.  On February 22, 2012 we planted cuttings in a mixture of 80% perlite, 20% peat moss and ___ dolomite lime.  We grew cuttings under ambient weather conditions outside the greenhouse at Humboldt State University.  (do I need to mention that they were exposed to herbivory?)
