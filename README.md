# Lanphere_Experiments

This repository contains data and code to reproduce results reported in the manuscript, "Trait plasticity is more important than genetic variation in determining species richness of associated communities".

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and use either the ipython notebook or Rmarkdown version of "reproduce_lanphere_analyses_and figures" to reproduce these analyses.
